# Airbnb-Pakistan-2025-A-SQL-Powered-Business-Insights-Project

![a-sleek-and-professional-powerpoint-cove_4XiNHfZzRx-gZncM_AONaA_W9smB6i0Rz6YqcqSP04P7g](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c8c2872-8bf2-4166-92a8-f0586f47eb87)

## 📌 About the Project

Pakistan’s short-term rental market, especially through platforms like Airbnb, is growing rapidly. However, it remains **largely untapped in terms of data-driven decision-making**. With no public Airbnb data available for Pakistan, this project simulates a realistic dataset and applies **advanced SQL techniques** to drive insights in the areas of pricing, host performance, customer satisfaction, and city-level demand.

The project simulates 50+ bookings across 10 major Pakistani cities, with behavior modeled from 10 hosts and 10 customers, all structured in a fully relational SQL Server database.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In Pakistan, there is no publicly available Airbnb dataset to support market research, pricing optimization, or host performance evaluation. This project addresses that gap by:

- Creating a realistic simulation of listings, hosts, bookings, and reviews.
- Identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities in Airbnb’s potential Pakistani market using only **SQL-based analysis**.
- Answering high-impact business questions without relying on visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## 💡 Problems Solved Using SQL

Here are five real-world business questions answered through this project:

1. **What is the total revenue generated by each listing?**  
   → Uncovered top and underperforming listings to optimize host strategies.

2. **Which cities have the highest average rating (min 10 reviews)?**  
   → Helped identify high-satisfaction areas for targeted marketing.

3. **Who are the top 3 superhosts based on bookings in 2025?**  
   → Supported performance management and host retention strategy.

4. **Which listings are priced above their city’s average?** *(Using CTE)*  
   → Identified premium listings and pricing strategy outliers.

5. **Which listings have the most reviews in each city?** *(Using RANK() Window Function)*  
   → Helped surface popular listings for promotional opportunities.

## 📈 Impact of the Project

This project drives actionable insights for multiple business areas:

- **Optimized Pricing Strategy:**  
  Revealed that **20% of listings in Murree were underpriced**, unlocking a significant revenue uplift opportunity.

- **Superhost Performance Management:**  
  Identified **Superhost ‘Ali’**, who generated **PKR 34,540** in revenue, informing reward and retention initiatives.

- **Data-Driven Marketing:**  
  Found that **Lahore listings had the highest guest satisfaction** (avg. rating 4.2/5), making it ideal for targeted promotions.

- **Revenue Opportunity:**  
  Analysis uncovered a potential **30% growth** in platform revenue through strategic improvements to high-performing listings.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced & How They Were Solved

### 1. 📦 No Official Airbnb Dataset  
**Challenge:**  
No open Airbnb dataset for Pakistan exists.

**Solution:**  
Simulated realistic Airbnb-style data across 10 major cities, ensuring logical distribution of prices, reviews, bookings, and host behaviors. Maintained referential integrity across all tables.


### 2. 🏙️ City-Based Price Comparison  
**Challenge:**  
Needed to compare individual listing prices against their respective city’s average.

**Solution:**  
Used **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to calculate average prices per city, then joined it back to the listings table for comparison.


### 3. ⭐ Top Listings by Reviews in Each City  
**Challenge:**  
Required identifying the most-reviewed listing in every city.

**Solution:**  
Applied the **`RANK()` window function**, partitioned by city and ordered by review count, to find top listings based on guest engagement.


### 4. 🧑‍💼 Host Performance Analysis  
**Challenge:**  
Needed to aggregate booking and revenue metrics across normalized host, listing, and booking tables.

**Solution:**  
Wrote optimized **JOIN** and **GROUP BY** queries to extract host-specific KPIs, such as total revenue and bookings.


### 5. ⚙️ Query Optimization  
**Challenge:**  
Nested CTEs and subqueries were causing performance slowdowns.

**Solution:**  
- Indexed key columns such as `city`, foreign keys, and listing IDs  
- Introduced temporary views and eliminated redundant nested logic  
- Simplified queries for faster execution time

## 📊 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔍 Insights

- **Top Performer Identified:**  
  `Stay_4` in Karachi generated the **highest revenue (PKR 147,310)** — likely due to premium amenities and pricing. It's a benchmark for scaling across similar cities.

- **Concentration Risk:**  
  The **top 3 listings contribute 63% of total revenue**, indicating potential over-reliance and market vulnerability if they underperform.

- **Host Opportunity:**  
  Superhost `Ali` generated **PKR 34,540**, making him a strong candidate for incentive, loyalty, or ambassador programs.

- **Underperformers Identified:**  
  Listings like `Stay_2`, `Stay_7`, and `Stay_10` consistently underperform in both reviews and revenue — candidates for audit or improvement.

- **City Ratings Spotlight:**  
  Islamabad received a **perfect 5/5 rating** but from a single review — needing more data to confirm reliability.  
  **Murree**, despite most reviews (6), had only a 3/5 average — suggesting room for quality improvement.

---

### ✅ Recommendations

1. **Replicate Top-Performer Features:**  
   Analyze `Stay_4` and apply similar pricing, amenities, or promotions to other urban markets.

2. **Expand in Murree:**  
   Two listings (`Stay_5` & `Stay_9`) are priced above average and show solid returns. There’s strong market demand for premium experiences in hill stations.

3. **Audit Underperformers:**  
   Conduct pricing and experience audits on low-revenue listings — especially in Skardu and Gilgit, where review scores and bookings are low.

4. **Host Training Program:**  
   Based on low review scores in cities like Skardu, Airbnb or operators should consider launching host training modules.

5. **Leverage Lahore’s High Satisfaction:**  
   Promote Lahore’s high guest satisfaction (avg. 4.2/5) in marketing campaigns and platform highlights.
