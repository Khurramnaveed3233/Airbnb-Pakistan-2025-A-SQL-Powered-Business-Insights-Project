## 📌 About the Project

Pakistan’s short-term rental market, especially through platforms like Airbnb, is growing rapidly. However, it remains **largely untapped in terms of data-driven decision-making**. With no public Airbnb data available for Pakistan, this project simulates a realistic dataset and applies **advanced SQL techniques** to drive insights in the areas of pricing, host performance, customer satisfaction, and city-level demand.

The project simulates 50+ bookings across 10 major Pakistani cities, with behavior modeled from 10 hosts and 10 customers, all structured in a fully relational SQL Server database.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In Pakistan, there is no publicly available Airbnb dataset to support market research, pricing optimization, or host performance evaluation. This project addresses that gap by:

- Creating a realistic simulation of listings, hosts, bookings, and reviews.
- Identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities in Airbnb’s potential Pakistani market using only **SQL-based analysis**.
- Answering high-impact business questions without relying on visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## 💡 Problems Solved Using SQL

Here are five real-world business questions answered through this project:

1. **What is the total revenue generated by each listing?**  
   → Uncovered top and underperforming listings to optimize host strategies.

2. **Which cities have the highest average rating (min 10 reviews)?**  
   → Helped identify high-satisfaction areas for targeted marketing.

3. **Who are the top 3 superhosts based on bookings in 2025?**  
   → Supported performance management and host retention strategy.

4. **Which listings are priced above their city’s average?** *(Using CTE)*  
   → Identified premium listings and pricing strategy outliers.

5. **Which listings have the most reviews in each city?** *(Using RANK() Window Function)*  
   → Helped surface popular listings for promotional opportunities.

  Identified **Superhost ‘Ali’**, who generated **PKR 34,540** in revenue, informing reward and retention initiatives.

- **Data-Driven Marketing:**  
  Found that **Lahore listings had the highest guest satisfaction** (avg. rating 4.2/5), making it ideal for targeted promotions.

- **Revenue Opportunity:**  
  Analysis uncovered a potential **30% growth** in platform revenue through strategic improvements to high-performing listings.

## 🛠️ Solution Section

### 🧰 Tools Used:
- **SQL Server**
- Simulated data (no external tools like Power BI or Excel used)

### 🧠 SQL Techniques Applied:
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for comparing listing prices to city averages
- **Window Functions (`RANK()`)** for identifying top performers by reviews
- **Joins & Aggregations** for calculating revenue, bookings, and host performance
- **Data Normalization**: Maintained referential integrity across listings, hosts, bookings, and reviews

### 🔑 Sample SQL Query – Listings Above City Average
```sql
WITH CityAvg AS (
  SELECT city, AVG(price_per_night) AS avg_price
  FROM listings
  GROUP BY city
)
SELECT l.listing_id, l.city, l.price_per_night, c.avg_price
FROM listings l
JOIN CityAvg c ON l.city = c.city
WHERE l.price_per_night > c.avg_price;

## 🧩 Challenges Faced & How They Were Solved

### 1. 📦 No Official Airbnb Dataset  
**Challenge:**  
No open Airbnb dataset for Pakistan exists.

**Solution:**  
Simulated realistic Airbnb-style data across 10 major cities, ensuring logical distribution of prices, reviews, bookings, and host behaviors. Maintained referential integrity across all tables.
